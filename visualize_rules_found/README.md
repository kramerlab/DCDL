Scripts to explore the visualization of the rules found by the SLS algorithm. 

Entry point is the script start.py where the hyperparameters can be changed. 
It can be changed: 

`one_against_all_array` which label should be tested against all others. 

`Number_of_disjunction_term_in_SLS` How many disjunctions may be used in the SLS. A small number provides general/discriminative rules and 
a big k  specific/characteristic rules
