## Logs of training neural net
In data_set_used/logs/ are the logs for training the nets.
## trained model/ 
In data_set_used/stored_models trained models are stored. 
 #### Update possibility (was not changed to be consistent with existing experiment results):
Save stored_models with label and time stemp in path.
At the moment the model are overwritten if a new experiment begins. 
## Intermediate results 
In data_set_used/ are the intermediate results (logik rules and output of the neural net)  of the experiment are stored
 #### Update possibility (was not changed to be consistent with existing experiment results):
Save intermediate results with label and time stemp in path.
At the moment the intermediate results are overwritten if a new experiment begins. 

## Results
